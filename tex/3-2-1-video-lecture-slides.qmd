## Token Relationships and Knowledge Graphs

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Tokens form the building blocks of text relationships and meaning in NLP.  
- Aspect-based sentiment analysis identifies sentiment tied to specific aspects or topics.  
- Knowledge graphs map relationships between entities to provide contextual insights.  
- Token relationships enhance machine understanding of complex linguistic structures.  
- These concepts drive applications in sentiment analysis, recommendations, and chatbots.

## Units of NLP Analysis

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- NLP processes text at various levels: texts, paragraphs, sentences, words, and tokens.  
- Texts provide overarching narratives; tokens are the smallest meaningful units.  
- Paragraphs and sentences act as natural segmentation points for processing.  
- Tokens are annotated with attributes like part-of-speech and syntactic role.  
- Understanding these units is key to granular and scalable text analysis.

## Applying SpaCy NLP Models to Dataframes

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- SpaCy provides pre-trained NLP models for efficient text processing.  
- Text and sentence dataframes integrate structured data with NLP outputs.  
- NLP models parse and enrich text with token, dependency, and entity annotations.  
- Batch processing of text improves efficiency for large datasets.  
- Practical applications include text classification, summarization, and sentiment analysis.

## Iterating Over SpaCy Documents

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Sentence-level dataframes organize text into manageable units for analysis.  
- SpaCy document objects provide linguistic annotations for each token.  
- Iterating enables extraction of sentence-specific attributes like entities or sentiments.  
- Combines structured data analysis with NLP insights for robust results.  
- Streamlines processes such as summarization, search indexing, and context identification.

## Text Normalization and Token Attributes

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Normalization reduces text variability by standardizing tokens.  
- Lemmatization extracts the base form of words for consistent analysis.  
- Token attributes, such as text and lemma, enable detailed linguistic understanding.  
- Improved token consistency enhances downstream NLP tasks like matching and clustering.  
- Normalization is essential for multilingual and noisy text processing.

## Infering Named Entity Recognition (NER)

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- NER identifies and categorizes entities like names, organizations, and dates.  
- Extracted entities provide structured insights from unstructured text.  
- Applications include content categorization, fraud detection, and customer sentiment analysis.  
- NER supports personalized recommendations and enhanced search capabilities.  
- It is fundamental to building knowledge graphs and question-answering systems.

## Infering Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- POS tagging assigns grammatical roles to tokens like nouns, verbs, and adjectives.  
- Captures the syntactic structure of text for deeper linguistic understanding.  
- Applications include syntax parsing, machine translation, and text generation.  
- POS tagging enhances accuracy in sentiment analysis and topic modeling.  
- Supports advanced NLP tasks like dependency parsing and coreference resolution.
