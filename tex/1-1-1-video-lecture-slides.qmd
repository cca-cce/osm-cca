## Sustainability communication content

* Define sustainability content both formally and functionally
* Formal content reflects environmental or social responsibility themes
* Functional content supports branding, compliance, and stakeholder engagement
* Communication influences perceptions of credibility and authenticity
* Dual analysis reveals intent, structure, and audience impact

---

## Online content sampling

* Sampling method influences research reliability and validity
* Random sampling is ideal but hard to apply in web contexts
* Purposive sampling targets relevant or contrasting examples
* Strategic sampling balances focus and generalizability
* Design choices must minimize bias in content selection

---

## Expectations about sustainability communication

* Choose between qualitative, quantitative, or mixed approaches
* Descriptive analysis explores patterns; explanatory seeks causes
* Linguistic analysis compares tone, terms, and rhetorical strategies
* Research begins with well-formed questions and hypotheses
* Methodological clarity improves interpretability and rigor

---

## Find online sustainability communication

* Select organizations aligned with your research objectives
* Study one or compare multiple for contrast and depth
* Target official websites as curated communication sources
* Identify and extract sustainability-related URLs
* Build a dataset from key pages like “CSR” or “Sustainability”

---

## Convert multimodal web pages to PDF

* Use browser print-to-PDF to capture entire web pages
* Preserves images, layout, and static design elements
* Enables analysis of multimodal communication forms
* Quick, user-friendly method requiring no programming
* Limitation: videos and interactive elements not captured

---

## Setting up an initial content database

* Ensure all collected content is stored in an accessible format
* Local storage is easy but lacks shareability and backup
* Cloud solutions like Google Drive support collaboration
* GitHub adds version control and traceability benefits
* A well-structured archive supports long-term analysis

---

## Organize communication content in folders

* Separate folders allow comparisons between organizations
* Normalize filenames and paths for consistent processing
* Folder structure simplifies automation and batch analysis
* PDFs often need OCR or text extraction for further use
* Good organization supports transparency and reproducibility

## Python Environments: Local, Cloud, Notebooks  
- Local environments require Python installation and configuration.  
- Cloud environments like Google Colab eliminate setup hurdles.  
- Notebooks provide interactive code execution and documentation.  
- Cloud environments offer scalability and resource management.  
- Notebooks support real-time code execution alongside markdown.
