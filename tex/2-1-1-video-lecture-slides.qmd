## Python Use Cases: Low vs. High-Code  

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Low-code leverages Pythonâ€™s simplicity for fast data analysis.  
- High-code applications involve deeper customization and algorithms.  
- Social sciences benefit from low-code data manipulation and visualization.  
- Computer science projects often require complex, high-code solutions.  
- Python accommodates both low-code and high-code workflows.

## Basic Python Syntax: Variables, Data Objects, Loops  

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Variables store information and data types define their nature.  
- Lists, dictionaries, and tuples organize data into structures.  
- Loops iterate over data to automate repetitive tasks.  
- Python syntax emphasizes simplicity and readability.  
- Mastery of basic syntax is essential for further programming skills.
