As we wrap up *AI-Aided Content Analysis of Sustainability Communication*, let's reflect on the bridge from decoding digital sustainability messages to exploring their effects on minds and hearts, behaviors and cognitions.

## paragraph 1

Now, take those content features you've extracted—themes in climate reports, visuals in greenwashing—and use them to test real effects on audiences. With your low-code skills, design experiments to see how messages shape thoughts and feelings in groups or individuals.

## paragraph 2

Start with surveys: Layer sentiment scores into questions to check attitude shifts—does hopeful framing ease eco-anxiety in young adults? Or try psychophysiological tools like eye-tracking to spot where eyes linger on flood images, or EEG for spikes at guilt trips like "cut your carbon."

## paragraph 3

For web-based experiments, it's easy and inclusive: A/B test urgency in social media posts with web surveys — does it boost arousal in city vs. rural folks? Track clicks or bias scores right in browsers, revealing how messages empower or alienate diverse groups.

## paragraph 4

Lund students, this amps up your theses with mixed methods. Researchers, it's a toolkit for stronger papers. Public folks, it shows how to critique comms that truly connect.

You've got the power to test sustainability talk's real touch. Experiment boldly, question deeply—what if our messages heal more than they inform? Stay curious. Until next time.
