## Functions of Texts in Sustainability Communication

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Informational texts provide data-driven insights and factual details.  
- Persuasive texts motivate audiences toward action or change.  
- Narrative texts create emotional connections to sustainability themes.  
- Visual-supported texts enhance accessibility and engagement.  
- Each text type targets specific audiences and communication goals.

## NLP and Challenges of Unstructured Text  

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- NLP applications include sentiment analysis, translation, and summarization.  
- Unstructured text often contains ambiguous language and incomplete sentences.  
- Domain-specific jargon and colloquialisms complicate processing.  
- Noise in data sources like social media adds layers of preprocessing needs.  
- Robust algorithms and preprocessing pipelines mitigate these challenges.

## Basic Concepts: Units, Tokens, and N-grams  

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Text units include sentences, words, and characters as analytical building blocks.  
- Tokens are the smallest logical units, often derived from words.  
- N-grams capture sequences of n tokens, revealing contextual patterns.  
- Common n-grams include bigrams (two words) and trigrams (three words).  
- These concepts underpin more advanced NLP tasks.

## Formats and Conversion to Plain Text  

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Text is often stored in formats like PDF, HTML, or Markdown.  
- PDFs may contain layout artifacts, complicating text extraction.  
- HTML requires parsing to remove tags and extract meaningful content.  
- Tools like Beautiful Soup and PDFMiner streamline these conversions.  
- Converting to plain text ensures compatibility with NLP workflows.

## Text Features: Readability, POS, and NER  

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Readability indices assess the complexity of written content.  
- POS tagging categorizes words by their grammatical function.  
- NER identifies and classifies specific entities, such as names and dates.  
- These features provide insights into the style and structure of text.  
- They are essential for contextual and thematic understanding in NLP.

## Reading Text into Dataframes and Preprocessing  

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Dataframes structure text data for analysis and visualization.  
- Normalization includes lowercasing and punctuation removal.  
- Tokenization splits text into analyzable units like words or phrases.  
- Pandas and NLTK are widely used for preprocessing workflows.  
- Clean, tokenized data is a prerequisite for most NLP tasks.

## Manifest Text Content and Frequency Analysis  

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
- Manifest content refers to explicitly observable text elements.  
- Sentence and word counts provide quantitative content metrics.  
- Word frequency analysis highlights key terms and dominant themes.  
- Visualizations like word clouds offer intuitive insights into text data.  
- These metrics are foundational for exploratory text analysis.
