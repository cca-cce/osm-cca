## Key takeaways and ethical perspectives

* Understand how AI can support content analysis in sustainability research
* Gain practical skills in text and image data analysis using low-code tools
* Learn to critically interpret results produced by machine learning models
* Explore ethical boundaries of automation in communication analysis
* Reflect on transparency, bias, and accountability in AI-supported research

---

## What You Learned in This Course

* Collect and organize sustainability content from real-world sources
* Analyze both textual and visual communication using Python notebooks
* Apply NLP and computer vision techniques in a social science context
* Summarize and visualize data to uncover communication patterns
* Connect computational methods to audience effects and strategic messaging

---

## Ethics of Automating Content Interpretation

* Question how algorithmic bias might shape findings
* Evaluate the limits of interpretability in automated results
* Discuss the role of the researcher in guiding and validating AI output
* Consider privacy and consent when collecting public digital content
* Integrate ethical reflection into research design and dissemination

---

## Analysis documentation and open science (Jupyter)

* Emphasize reproducibility through transparent workflows
* Store data, code, and results in accessible formats
* Use cloud platforms and version control for collaborative research
* Frame analysis in ways that support peer review and replication
* Connect computational practice with open science values
* computer lab: download ipython notebook from google colab

---

## Using Jupyter Notebooks to Ensure Reproducibility

* Quarto integrates code, output, and documentation in one file
* Supports reproducible research with automated execution
* Allows easy conversion to HTML, PDF, or Word for publication
* Embeds metadata, citations, and environment settings
* Ideal for sharing transparent, well-structured analytical reports

---

## Communicating AI-aided content analysis (Quarto)

* Translate technical findings into accessible narratives
* Use visualizations to highlight patterns in sustainability messaging
* Connect communication effects with organizational strategies
* Present methods and results clearly for both technical and non-technical audiences
* Position findings within broader ethical and scientific discussions
* computer lab: convert ipython notebook to quarto document

---

## Turning Your Analysis into a Research Publication

* Start with a well-documented Google Colab or Quarto notebook
* Define a clear research question with reproducible methods
* Use structured visualizations to support interpretations
* Align findings with existing literature and frameworks
* Submit to journals focusing on digital methods, media studies, or sustainability communication
