        "**Sustainability Communication and Greenwashing: Definitions and Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Sustainability communication* refers to how organizations convey their environmental efforts and commitments to stakeholders, including customers, investors, and the public. It encompasses the strategies and messages used to inform about sustainable practices, goals, and achievements.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Greenwashing* is the practice where an organization gives a false impression or provides misleading information about how its products are more environmentally sound. It's a form of deceptive marketing intended to present an eco-friendly image that doesn't align with reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Relationship Between Sustainability Communication and Greenwashing**\n",
        "\n",
        "While sustainability communication aims to transparently share genuine environmental initiatives, greenwashing undermines this by distorting the truth. Effective sustainability communication builds trust and accountability, whereas greenwashing can damage an organization's reputation and lead to consumer skepticism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Case Study: Preem and Vattenfall**\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider two organizations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Preem**: A Swedish petroleum company primarily involved in refining and selling fossil fuels.\n",
        "- **Vattenfall**: A Swedish power company engaged in energy production, including renewables like wind and hydroelectric power, as well as traditional sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both companies engage in sustainability communication to highlight their environmental efforts. However, their core businesses differ, which might influence the content and tone of their messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using spaCy NLP to Analyze Sustainability Communication**\n",
        "\n",
        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like **spaCy** can help analyze the language used in sustainability reports, press releases, and other communications from these organizations. By examining tokens (words) and parts of speech (POS), we can gain insights into their messaging strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how we can proceed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Tokenization and POS Tagging**: Using spaCy, we tokenize the text and assign POS tags to each token, identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Frequency Analysis**:\n",
        "   - **Adjectives**: Analyze the use of descriptive words such as \"sustainable,\" \"green,\" \"renewable,\" or \"clean.\" A high frequency of positive environmental adjectives might be used to enhance the company's eco-friendly image.\n",
        "   - **Nouns and Verbs**: Examine the key nouns and verbs to understand what actions the company emphasizes (e.g., \"reducing emissions,\" \"investing,\" \"innovating\").\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Comparative Analysis**:\n",
        "   - **Preem**: As a fossil fuel company, Preem might focus on terms like \"transition,\" \"carbon capture,\" or \"efficiency.\" The language may highlight efforts to mitigate environmental impact while continuing core operations.\n",
        "   - **Vattenfall**: With a significant stake in renewables, Vattenfall's communication might frequently include words like \"wind power,\" \"sustainability,\" and \"renewable energy,\" reflecting a strategic shift toward greener energy sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Identifying Potential Greenwashing Indicators**:\n",
        "   - **Discrepancies**: Look for a mismatch between the frequency of positive environmental language and the company's actual environmental performance or core activities.\n",
        "   - **Vagueness and Jargon**: Excessive use of buzzwords without concrete actions or data might indicate greenwashing.\n",
        "   - **Overemphasis on Minor Initiatives**: Highlighting small sustainable projects while major operations remain environmentally harmful.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Determining Levels of Greenwashing**\n",
        "\n",
        "By quantitatively analyzing the language used, we can infer the level of greenwashing:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **High Level**: Predominant use of positive environmental adjectives with little mention of substantive actions or acknowledgment of environmental challenges.\n",
        "- **Moderate Level**: Balanced use of positive language and discussion of both achievements and ongoing issues.\n",
        "- **Low Level**: Transparent communication with specific data, acknowledging areas for improvement, and outlining concrete steps being taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying spaCy NLP to sustainability communications allows us to dissect the linguistic patterns and assess the authenticity of an organization's environmental messaging. By examining the parts of speech and token frequency, we can gain insights into whether companies like Preem and Vattenfall are engaging in genuine sustainability efforts or potentially greenwashing their practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis not only sheds light on their communication strategies but also promotes greater accountability and encourages more truthful and transparent sustainability reporting."

Around 12 per cent are estimated to\\noriginate from the production of what we eat. \\n\\nOne contributing factor is the production and\\nuse of fertilisers. A century ago, two German\\nchemists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch,\\ndeveloped a new and inexpensive way to use\\nnitrogen (N2) from the air to produce ammonia\\n(NH3), which is the base ingredient of\\nfertilisers. This boosted the use which in turn\\nmade it possible to feed the growing world\\npopulation. \\n\\nToday, world agriculture is entirely dependent\\non the discovery. Without fertilisers, crop yields\\nwould be significantly lower and would only be\\nenough for half of today\\u2019s world population. \\n\\nOne problem however is that ammonia\\nproduction causes large carbon dioxide\\nemissions. These come  from the fossil\\nmethane normally used in the process, as the\\nhydrogen atoms that are used while the rest of\\nthe methane, the carbon dioxide, is released\\ninto the air. Today, each tonne of this so-called\\ngrey ammonia gives around two tonnes of\\ncarbon dioxide. In total, ammonia production\\nworldwide is estimated to emit 450 million\\ntonnes of CO2, of which fertilisers account for\\n70 per cent. \\n\\nBut there is a solution. Instead of using\\n\\n2 of 8\\n\\n10/10/24, 15:48\\n\\n\\fFossil-free fertilisers: A key to cutting carbon emissions - V...\\n\\nhttps://group.vattenfall.com/press-and-media/newsroom/2...\\n\\nmethane, hydrogen can be produced from\\npure water. This is made with electrolysis using\\nelectricity from sources such as solar and wind\\npower. This way the ammonia becomes \\u2018green\\u2019\\nand fertilisers free from carbon emissions. \\n\\n shows that such a\\n\\nanalysis by McKinsey\\n\\nAn \\ntransition would be relatively straightforward,\\nmainly because the ammonia is exactly the\\nsame product, except that the hydrogen is\\nfossil-free. In addition, there are relatively few\\nfertiliser producers in the world, making a\\ntransformation less complicated than getting\\nmillions of farmers around the world to change\\ntheir behaviour. And last but not least, the\\nclimate impact is relatively large compared to\\nthe extra cost. \\n\\nThe transition has started \\n\\nIn many places, the transition has already\\nstarted, with new green hydrogen and green\\nammonia projects starting up around the\\nworld. \\n\\nOne example is\\n\\nYara International's green ammonia plant in\\nHer\\u00f8ya, Norway\\n\\n. The plant, which opened in June this year, is\\ncurrently the largest of its kind in Europe, with\\nproduction contributing to reduced emissions\\nof 41,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.\\n\\n3 of 8\\n\\n10/10/24, 15:48\\n\\n\\fFossil-free fertilisers: A key to cutting carbon emissions - V...\\n\\nhttps://group.vattenfall.com/press-and-media/newsroom/2...\\n\\nYara has also signed one of the world's first\\ncommercial agreements on fossil-free\\nfertilisers together with Swedish Lantm\\u00e4nnen. \\n\\nAnother exciting example is in Kenya. There,\\nKenya Nut Company has started a small fossil-\\nfree plant for fertiliser production on its\\npremises. The plant is built by an American\\nstart-up, \\nTalus Renewables\\npanels that generate electricity to produce\\nhydrogen and then ammonia.

But overall, a shift in ammonia\\nproduction would have a major impact.\\nEspecially as ammonia also has great potential\\nas a CO2-free fuel. \\n\\nThei is demonstrated in Minnesota, where the\\nstate university runs a research farm that uses\\nwind power to produce ammonia.

This is almost a quarter of the\\n\\nrefinery's total carbon dioxide emissions.\\n\\nFACTS: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)\\n\\nCCS stands for Carbon Capture Storage (geological storage of carbon\\n\\ndioxide). It is a well-proven technology to capture and transport carbon\\n\\ndioxide to geological storage under the seabed, just as nature itself stores oil\\n\\nand gas.\\n\\nHow much can carbon emissions be reduced\\n\\nCarbon dioxide emissions in Sweden are currently around 50 million tons per\\n\\nyear. If you also include emissions from biogenic sources, the total emissions\\n\\nare about 70 million tons per year.\\n\\nBy introducing carbon capture at the 27 Swedish industrial plants that\\n\\ngenerate more than half a million tons per year, emissions could be reduced\\n\\nby 23 million tons, of which 14 million tons are of fossil origin.\\n\\nSource: The report Avskiljning, transport och lagring av koldioxid i Sverige\\n\\n(\\\"Carbon Capture, Transport and Storage in Sweden\\\") by Filip Johnsson and\\n\\nJan Kj\\u00e4rstad, Chalmers University of Technology (2019).\\n\\n2 of 8\\n\\n10/10/24, 15:46\\n\\n\\fCarbon Capture and Storage | Preem\\n\\nhttps://www.preem.com/en/about-us/projects/carbon-capture/\\n\\n3 of 8\\n\\n10/10/24, 15:46\\n\\n\\fCarbon Capture and Storage | Preem\\n\\nhttps://www.preem.com/en/about-us/projects/carbon-capture/\\n\\nOur plans for carbon capture\\n\\n\\u2022 In Project Preem CCS, we are considering building a CCS plant in\\n\\nLysekil.

NEWS SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENT SEPTEMBER MIN Fossil-free fertilisers: A key to cutting carbon emissions We depend on fertilisers. Without them, half of us would probably starve. On the other hand, fertiliser production contributes to climate change. Luckily, fossil-free electricity and hydrogen could solve the problem. By Lars-Magnus Kihlstrm of //, : Fossil-free fertilisers: A key to cutting carbon emissions - V... https://group.vattenfall.com/press-and-media/newsroom/... Agriculture is one of the sectors that contributes most to greenhouse gas emissions. Around per cent are estimated to originate from the production of what we eat. One contributing factor is the production and use of fertilisers. A century ago, two German chemists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, developed a new and inexpensive way to use nitrogen (N) from the air to produce ammonia (NH), which is the base ingredient of fertilisers. This boosted the use which in turn made it possible to feed the growing world population. Today, world agriculture is entirely dependent on the discovery. Without fertilisers, crop yields would be significantly lower and would only be enough for half of todays world population. One problem however is that ammonia production causes large carbon dioxide emissions. These come from the fossil methane normally used in the process, as the hydrogen atoms that are used while the rest of the methane, the carbon dioxide, is released into the air. Today, each tonne of this so-called grey ammonia gives around two tonnes of carbon dioxide. In total, ammonia production worldwide is estimated to emit million tonnes of CO, of which fertilisers account for per cent. But there is a solution. Instead of using of //, : Fossil-free fertilisers: A key to cutting carbon emissions - V... https://group.vattenfall.com/press-and-media/newsroom/... methane, hydrogen can be produced from pure water. This is made with electrolysis using electricity from sources such as solar and wind power. This way the ammonia becomes green and fertilisers free from carbon emissions. shows that such a analysis by McKinsey An transition would be relatively straightforward, mainly because the ammonia is exactly the same product, except that the hydrogen is fossil-free. In addition, there are relatively few fertiliser producers in the world, making a transformation less complicated than getting millions of farmers around the world to change their behaviour. And last but not least, the climate impact is relatively large compared to the extra cost. The transition has started In many places, the transition has already started, with new green hydrogen and green ammonia projects starting up around the world. One example is Yara International's green ammonia plant in Herya, Norway . The plant, which opened in June this year, is currently the largest of its kind in Europe, with production contributing to reduced emissions of , tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. of //, : Fossil-free fertilisers: A key to cutting carbon emissions - V... https://group.vattenfall.com/press-and-media/newsroom/... Yara has also signed one of the world's first commercial agreements on fossil-free fertilisers together with Swedish Lantmnnen. Another exciting example is in Kenya. There, Kenya Nut Company has started a small fossil- free plant for fertiliser production on its premises. The plant is built by an American start-up, Talus Renewables panels that generate electricity to produce hydrogen and then ammonia. One tonne of ammonia is produced every day and spread on the crops. , with solar The average bag of fertiliser in sub-Saharan Africa travels , kilometres, Talus founder With a small Hiro Iwanaga told Bloomberg. green ammonia plant, like the one in Kenya, you can locally produce a critical raw material, carbon free. Agriculture faces major challenges in solving climate emissions, and ammonia production is just one of them. But overall, a shift in ammonia production would have a major impact. Especially as ammonia also has great potential as a CO-free fuel. Thei is demonstrated in Minnesota, where the state university runs a research farm that uses wind power to produce ammonia. It is then used for fertiliser, but also as fuel for tractors, to store energy for days without wind, and for heating to dry grain. In this way, the carbon of //, : Fossil-free fertilisers: A key to cutting carbon emissions - V... https://group.vattenfall.com/press-and-media/newsroom/... footprint can be reduced by as much as per cent. That's transformative. For deep decarbonisation of agriculture, you switch to green ammonia, says Michael Reese, director of the University of Minnesota project .

This is why we are working actively to enable the capture and storage of carbon dioxide, known as CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage). Tests have been conducted with good results, and the plan is to establish full- scale plants in the late s. of //, : Carbon Capture and Storage | Preem https://www.preem.com/en/about-us/projects/carbon-capture/ The \\\"Preem CCS\\\" pilot project has analyzed everything from capturing to storing carbon dioxide for almost three years. The results indicate the technology is feasible, but some practical issues remain. With the help of a CCS plant, Preem could reduce the emissions from the refinery in Lysekil by up to , tons. This is almost a quarter of the refinery's total carbon dioxide emissions. FACTS: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) CCS stands for Carbon Capture Storage (geological storage of carbon dioxide). It is a well-proven technology to capture and transport carbon dioxide to geological storage under the seabed, just as nature itself stores oil and gas. How much can carbon emissions be reduced Carbon dioxide emissions in Sweden are currently around million tons per year. If you also include emissions from biogenic sources, the total emissions are about million tons per year. By introducing carbon capture at the Swedish industrial plants that generate more than half a million tons per year, emissions could be reduced by million tons, of which million tons are of fossil origin.
