        "1. **Word Count**:\n",
        "   - The `apply` function is used on the `cleaned_text` column to calculate the word count. The `lambda` function splits each cleaned text string into words using `split()` and then calculates the length of the resulting list using `len(x.split())`. This word count is stored in a new column `word_count`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Character Count**:\n",
        "   - Similarly, the `apply` function calculates the character count by applying `len(x)` directly on the `cleaned_text` string. This counts the total number of characters (including spaces) and stores the result in a new column `character_count`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Updated DataFrame**:\n",
        "   - The DataFrame is then printed again, now including the `word_count` and `character_count` columns, providing additional insights into the text length and structure.\n"
