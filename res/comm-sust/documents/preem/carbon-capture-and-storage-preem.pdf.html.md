Our commitment to carbon  
capture and storage  

Preem's refineries are among Sweden's largest point sources  

of carbon dioxide emissions. This is why we are working  

actively to enable the capture and storage of carbon dioxide,  

known as CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage). Tests have been  

conducted with good results, and the plan is to establish full-  

scale plants in the late 2020s.

The "Preem CCS" pilot project has analyzed everything from capturing to  

storing carbon dioxide for almost three years. The results indicate the  

technology is feasible, but some practical issues remain.  

With the help of a CCS plant, Preem could reduce the emissions from the  

refinery in Lysekil by up to 500,000 tons. This is almost a quarter of the  

refinery's total carbon dioxide emissions.  

FACTS: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)  

CCS stands for Carbon Capture Storage (geological storage of carbon  

dioxide). It is a well-proven technology to capture and transport carbon  

dioxide to geological storage under the seabed, just as nature itself stores
oil  

and gas.  

How much can carbon emissions be reduced  

Carbon dioxide emissions in Sweden are currently around 50 million tons per  

year. If you also include emissions from biogenic sources, the total emissions  

are about 70 million tons per year.  

By introducing carbon capture at the 27 Swedish industrial plants that  

generate more than half a million tons per year, emissions could be reduced  

by 23 million tons, of which 14 million tons are of fossil origin.

Our plans for carbon capture  

• In Project Preem CCS, we are considering building a CCS plant in  

Lysekil. In 2020, we conducted carbon capture tests at the Lysekil  

refinery with good results.  

• We also plan to install equipment for carbon dioxide capture,  

purification and liquefaction at the Gothenburg refinery. This is  

contingent on the realization of the HVO project for increased  

production of renewable fuels.  

• Preem is one of the partners in CinfraCap, a unique collaborative  

project in Gothenburg to find a cost-effective and climate-smart way  

to transport and temporarily store captured carbon dioxide.

• The idea is that the captured carbon dioxide will be liquefied and  

transported to the Northern Lights project's future storage site in the  

bedrock under the North Sea.  

• This technology is expected to reduce Preem's carbon dioxide  

emissions by half a million tons annually. It is one of many necessary  

steps towards the goal of a climate-neutral value chain by 2035.
