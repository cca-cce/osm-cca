Broadened Raw Material Base  

Preem buys crude oil and renewable raw materials from all over the world.  

They are transported to the refineries in Gothenburg and Lysekil to be  

processed into finished products that are then sold in Sweden and Norway  

or exported to the international market.

Today, Preem uses renewable raw materials such as used  

frying oil, fats from the food industry, and processed residual  

products from the forestry, wood and pulp industry, such as  

tall oil and pyrolysis oil from sawdust.  

Preem's transition to an increasingly renewable production means an  

increasing need for renewable raw materials, suppliers and partnerships. We  

also need to ensure that renewable raw materials are sustainable in the  

long-term and do not entail new sustainability risks for the environment or  

society.  

In the process of identifying more sustainable raw materials and developing  

the processes for converting these into biofuels, Preem conducts research  

and development internally and together with academia, research institutes  

and other partners.  

Purchase of fossil raw materials in 2022  

Preem purchases an average of 300 000 barrels of crude oil from suppliers  

worldwide each trading day. The single most significant part, 72 percent, of  

the crude oil comes from Norway and the North Sea (2022), followed by  

Nigeria (10 %) and the USA (7 %).  

A better journey.
