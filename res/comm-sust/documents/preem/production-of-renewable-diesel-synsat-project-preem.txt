We are increasing the
production of renewable
diesel

Switching to more renewables

At the refinery in Lysekil, the reconstruction of the so-called

Synsat plant that produces diesel is underway. The plant is

being rebuilt to enable renewable blending that increases

Preem's renewable production capacity by about 900,000

cubic meters per year.

The project also means that a corresponding amount of fossil fuel will be

phased out. The conversion is ongoing and is expected to be completed in

the first half of 2024.

Reduced carbon dioxide emissions in the last phase

Eighty-five percent of the carbon dioxide emissions in Preem's value chain

take place at the user level. The manufacturing process accounts for about

4 percent. The converted Synsat plant reduces the fossil carbon dioxide

emissions in the user stage by 1.2 - 1.7 million tons per year. Emissions of

carbon dioxide at the refinery will not increase.

1. DELIVERY AND STORAGE OF RAW MATERIAL

The renewable raw material, such as tall oil or rapeseed oil, is delivered

to the refinery by ship. There it is stored in tanks and then pumped into

the plant and mixed with other raw materials.

2. OXYGEN IS REMOVED

Renewable raw materials contain oxygen, which needs to be removed.

This is carried out in a newly built reactor by adding large amounts of

hydrogen gas, which binds the oxygen. The residual product is water.

3. WATER PURIFICATION

In a new sour water stripper unit, the residual water is cleaned of

hydrogen sulfide and either reused in other parts of the refinery or

sent for treatment in Preem's wastewater treatment plant.

4. PURIFICATION FROM SULPHUR

The product is then sent to an existing reactor to purify the sulfur from

the fossil fuel. As in the previous reactor, this takes place at a pressure

of around 50 bar and a temperature of 300-400 degrees. The sulfur is

captured and recycled.

5. AROMATICS ARE REMOVED

In the next reactor, which is also from the original Synsat plant,

aromatics are removed from the fossil part of the feedstock in the

same way as before. The aromatics are removed to minimize particulate

emissions from the finished diesel. Aromatics are not present in the

renewable part.

6. COOLING PROPERTIES ARE IMPROVED

In a newly built reactor, the cooling properties of the renewable part of

the fuel are then improved. This is done by isomerizing the carbon

molecules, i.e. converting the straight carbon molecules into branched

ones.

7. THE FRACTIONATION TOWERS

Gas and light hydrocarbons formed during the process are separated

out in two existing fractionation towers – one for the gasses and one

for the light hydrocarbons – and then recycled.

8. HYDROGEN PLANTS

Renewable raw materials require more hydrogen than fossil crude oil to

be converted into diesel. The increased hydrogen demand is met by

installing a new Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plant. It recovers,

purifies and concentrates hydrogen from the residual streams of other

plants at the refinery. The existing hydrogen production facility, the

Hydrogen Production Unit (HPU), is also being expanded for increased

production.

Facts: Synsat project

Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant at the Lysekil refinery to increase

renewable diesel production.

Renewable production started at the end of 2020 with a low blend of

rapeseed oil. A major refurbishment is planned for a large-scale co-

production with up to 40% renewable raw material, increasing our renewable

production by 650,000 - 950,000 annually.

The plant is planned to be in operation by 2024.
