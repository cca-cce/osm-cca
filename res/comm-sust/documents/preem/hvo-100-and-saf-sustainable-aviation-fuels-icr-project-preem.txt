Starting in 2024, we are rebuilding the so-called IsoCracker

plant (ICR) at the refinery in Lysekil. The plant is currently

being used for the production of diesel. After the conversion,

the plant will produce renewable aviation fuel (biojet/SAF)

and renewable diesel.

The investment enables Preem to become the largest producer of

renewable aviation fuel in Northern Europe, and one of the largest

producers of renewable fuels for road transportation.

The reconstruction of the plant will begin in 2024 and is scheduled for

completion in 2027. It is expected to provide Preem with an additional 1.2

million cubic meters of renewable production capacity. This can be

compared to the total capacity of about 530,000 cubic meters per year in

2023. At the same time, Preem is reducing its fossil fuel production capacity

by an equivalent amount.

In total, the investment is counted to reduce annual fossil fuel emissions at

the user level by 2-3 million tons of CO2e, and around 200,000 tons of

CO2e locally at the Lysekil refinery*.

• Reduced fossil emissions (Scope 1-3): Approx -2-3 million tons of

CO2e   

• Reduced fossil emissions (Scope 1): Approx -200,000 tons CO2e
• Products: Biojet/SAF, HVO
• Production capacity, SAF: ~600 000 m3
• Production capacity, HVO: ~600,000 m3

*How we calculated

One cubic meter of crude oil corresponds to approximately 3 tons of fossil

carbon dioxide. By using renewable raw materials, such as rapeseed oil, tall

oil, and animal fats, the fossil carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced by

65-95 percent.

When Preem produces 1.2 million cubic meters of renewable fuels with a raw

material that results in approximately 60-85 percent lower fossil emissions,

the fossil carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced by between 2 and 3

million tons.

1 200 000 x 3 x 0,6/0,85 = 2 000 000/3 000 000.

By phasing out the fossil production, the local emissions at the refinery can

be reduced by 200,000 tons of fossil carbon dioxide equivalents – mixed

fossil emission gases whose climate impact is calculated in comparison with

an emission of fossil carbon dioxide.
