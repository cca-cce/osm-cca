Vattenfall expands circular  
targets on wind turbine  
components  

In 2021, Vattenfall committed to an  

immediate landfill ban and set a goal to  

recycle 50 per cent of all wind turbine  

blades from its owned farms by 2025,  

with a target of 100 per cent by 2030.  

Building on this commitment, the  

company is now incorporating nacelle  

canopies and nose cones into its  

strategy, enforcing an immediate ban on  

landfilling these materials. The expanded  

target is already being integrated into  

existing wind farm decommissioning  

contracts.

“Expanding our recycling target is a crucial  
step towards achieving a circular business by  
2030,” said Eva Julius-Philipp, Director of  
Environment & Sustainability at Vattenfall BA  
Wind. “Our aim is to ensure that all  
decommissioned turbine composite materials  
are processed through circular methods –  
such as reuse, refurbishment repurposing, and  
recycling. This will prevent composite waste  
from ending up in landfills and instead make it  
available for second-life applications. By  
addressing this now, we avoid the risk of these  
materials being lost for the circular economy.”  

Collaborations with various partners are  
already underway to refurbish, repurpose, or  
recycle turbine components. Notable projects  
include a concept study with Lloyd's  
Arkitektkontor in Denmark to repurpose  
turbine blades for use in parking structures,  
and a Dutch initiative to convert a nacelle into  
a tiny house, set to be showcased during  
Dutch Design Week in October. Additionally, at  
the Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm,  
three sets of recyclable blades from Siemens  
Gamesa are being tested, designed to simplify  
recycling with low carbon emissions at the end  
of their life cycle.

“To develop effective large-scale commercial  
solutions for recycling composite materials,  
extensive research is essential. We aim to  
signal to our partners our commitment to  
pursuing innovative collaborations. Given that  
wind industry composite materials represent  
only about 10 per cent of the total, it’s crucial  
that other sectors also adopt ambitious  
recycling goals to prevent landfill disposal,”  
says Helle Herk-Hansen, Vice President  
Environment.  

In conjunction with this announcement, ECHT,  
regie in transitie and University of Leeds are  
launching the Circular Wind Guide. This guide,  
based on the scientific publication “A  
Framework and Baseline for the Integration of  
a Sustainable Circular Economy in Offshore  
Wind” by Dr. Anne Velenturf from the  
University of Leeds, introduces implemented  
circular strategies for the wind sector.  
Presented in Hamburg today. Vattenfall, as a  
proud partner, supports this initiative and  
hopes it will inspire others in the wind industry  
to develop their own sustainable solutions.  

Earlier this month, the commitment to  
achieving 100 per cent circular outflow of  
permanent magnets from decommissioned  
wind farms by 2030 was also announced by  
Vattenfall.
