UN development
goals

Vattenfall's strategy is in line with the

UN's sustainable development goals.

In 2016, based on our materiality analysis, an

analysis of our strategic objectives, and internal

dialogues and workshops, Vattenfall identified six

goals that are most relevant to the company and

to which it can provide the most meaningful

global contribution. They continue to be our six

prioritised UN sustainable development goals to

this day.

Sustainable development goals

The United Nations' sustainable development goals are a

call for action to promote prosperity while protecting the

planet.

Vattenfall also affects several other goals locally

(for example 5 Gender equality, 14 Life below

water, 15 Life on land) or via suppliers (for

example 6 Clean water and sanitation, 8 Decent

working conditions and economic growth, 10

Reduced inequality).

How is Vattenfall going to achieve
the six prioritised goals?

GOAL 7 Affordable and clean energy is central

to our portfolio of energy production assets.

Fossil-free electricity generation is our foundation

for value creation. 

Vattenfall has continued to grow and develop its

clean and affordable energy pipeline that span

various renewable energy sources and

technologies, such as wind farms, solar parks,

and battery storage. Currently, Vattenfall operates

5.4 GW of installed capacity in wind and solar

power. 

Vattenfall has been using

Life Cycle Assessments

 as a tool to evaluate

and map the environmental impact of electricity

generation activities from a full value chain

perspective since the early 1990s. Customers in

key markets are able to buy electricity with

verified  environmental data from certified

Environmental Production Declaration (EPDs).

Vattenfall develops new products that enable

customers to generate their own energy (solar,

heat pumps) and even sell it to Vattenfall or

others (PowerPeers). In the Netherlands,

Vattenfall has joined a network with other large

companies to share learnings on social billing

and prevent debts becoming problematic.

Together with for example insurance companies,

banks, several cities and municipalities like

Amsterdam and Almere, Vattenfall finds solutions

that prevent customers from falling into the

financial debt trap. 

Our e-mobility investment reflects our ambition to drive

development.

GOAL 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure

is the goal where Vattenfall has initiated various

new partnerships and projects, such as

collaborations with energy-intensive Swedish

industries like SSAB/LKAB. Vattenfall has

developed and maintained energy infrastructure

for years. Hence, sustainable retrofitting activities,

such as those in our heat operations in the

Netherlands or upgrades, like those in our hydro

operations, are core to our business. 

GOAL 11 Sustainable cities and communities.

Vattenfall’s cooperation with Uppsala is a good

example of realising a common climate target

with a city (the climate protocol was unique in

nature and very much before its time and has

now been followed by a renewed cooperation

agreement).

We strive to invest in infrastructure (electricity,

district heating with renewable fuels and waste

incineration, remote cooling, e-mobility charging)

and collaborate with consumers, politicians and

businesses in the cities. The goal also includes

“safeguarding the world's cultural and natural

heritage”, which is reflected in Vattenfall’s

cooperation with local communities, such as Pen

y Cymoedd and Sami, and former Sorbs in

Eastern Germany. 

GOAL 12 Responsible consumption and

production fits hand in hand with our purpose to

enable fossil freedom that drives society forward.

We want to make it possible for our customers to

move, make and live fossil free so we are

transforming the way we consume resources and

produce energy. 

Vattenfall’s entire CO2 roadmap is about sustainable

production.

When designing,  procuring, and constructing

energy infrastructure, we work to reduce the use

7 of 14

10/10/24, 15:47

UN's sustainable development goals - Vattenfall

of primary raw materials and favour materials

which are fossil-free, recycled or biogenic. For

example, on Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm, we

have incorporated a portion of wind turbines

which have recyclable blades Vattenfall strives to

maximise the value of resources in its value

chain, such as using excess heat from various

third parties for local heating networks. For

example, AstaReal’s algae cultivation is now

heating up to 2,500 apartments in Gustavsberg,

Sweden.  

Resource efficiency, reduction of hazardous

chemicals, waste, emissions to air and water are

also relevant to Goal 12. Vattenfall is working in

several ways to contirubte in these areas, for

example by substituting  creosote poles in

Distribution with new modern poles. There also

are continuous discussions and follow-up with

the business on chemicals and waste connected

to circular economy. Read more on Vattenfall's

resource management. 

GOAL 13 Climate action. Vattenfall is taking action

today and is committed to reducing

emissions. Our focus and our purpose to enable

fossil freedom is completely in line with this goal.

and when we aim to reach net zero and limit

global warming to 1.5 °C.  

Furthermore, wind power initiatives, the

conversion of the lignite plant Klingenberg to gas,

customer offerings such as EnergyWatch and

heat pumps, clear product declarations such as

EPD, collaborations with suppliers and customers

and attracting energy-intensive industries, such

as data centres, to Sweden from countries with

a higher share of fossil in its electricity production

are proof points and success stories of our

commitment. 

GOAL 17 Partnerships for the goals. Major

cooperation is in many ways a prerequisite for

success, as the goals need to be on a large scale

to have global impact. Vattenfall has intensified

cooperation with other players. For example,

Vattenfall was a founding member of the First

Movers Coalition and advocates of the now

signed the International Responsible Business

Conduct Agreement for the Renewable Energy

Sector.  

Whether it is on multinational or local level, we

apply this partnership approach to the

electrification of the transport sector and

industries, the construction of wind power and

providing our customers with sustainable

products  in cooperation with for example

Brainheart and Varmt & Skönt in Sweden, as well

as helping our larger customers achieve

sustainable production through large scale

industry decarbonisation.
