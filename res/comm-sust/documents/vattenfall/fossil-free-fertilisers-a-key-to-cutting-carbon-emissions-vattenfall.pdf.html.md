Fossil-free fertilisers: A key to  
cutting carbon emissions  

We depend on fertilisers. Without them,  

half of us would probably starve. On the  

other hand, fertiliser production  

contributes to climate change. Luckily,  

fossil-free electricity and hydrogen could  

solve the problem.

Agriculture is one of the sectors that  
contributes most to greenhouse gas  
emissions. Around 12 per cent are estimated to  
originate from the production of what we eat.  

One contributing factor is the production and  
use of fertilisers. A century ago, two German  
chemists, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch,  
developed a new and inexpensive way to use  
nitrogen (N2) from the air to produce ammonia  
(NH3), which is the base ingredient of  
fertilisers. This boosted the use which in turn  
made it possible to feed the growing world  
population.  

Today, world agriculture is entirely dependent  
on the discovery. Without fertilisers, crop yields  
would be significantly lower and would only be  
enough for half of today’s world population.  

One problem however is that ammonia  
production causes large carbon dioxide  
emissions. These come from the fossil  
methane normally used in the process, as the  
hydrogen atoms that are used while the rest of  
the methane, the carbon dioxide, is released  
into the air. Today, each tonne of this so-called  
grey ammonia gives around two tonnes of  
carbon dioxide. In total, ammonia production  
worldwide is estimated to emit 450 million  
tonnes of CO2, of which fertilisers account for  
70 per cent.  

But there is a solution. Instead of using

methane, hydrogen can be produced from  
pure water. This is made with electrolysis using  
electricity from sources such as solar and wind  
power. This way the ammonia becomes ‘green’  
and fertilisers free from carbon emissions.  

shows that such a  

analysis by McKinsey  

An  
transition would be relatively straightforward,  
mainly because the ammonia is exactly the  
same product, except that the hydrogen is  
fossil-free. In addition, there are relatively few  
fertiliser producers in the world, making a  
transformation less complicated than getting  
millions of farmers around the world to change  
their behaviour. And last but not least, the  
climate impact is relatively large compared to  
the extra cost.  

The transition has started  

In many places, the transition has already  
started, with new green hydrogen and green  
ammonia projects starting up around the  
world.  

One example is  

Yara International's green ammonia plant in  
Herøya, Norway  

. The plant, which opened in June this year, is  
currently the largest of its kind in Europe, with  
production contributing to reduced emissions  
of 41,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.

Yara has also signed one of the world's first  
commercial agreements on fossil-free  
fertilisers together with Swedish Lantmännen.  

Another exciting example is in Kenya. There,  
Kenya Nut Company has started a small fossil-  
free plant for fertiliser production on its  
premises. The plant is built by an American  
start-up,  
Talus Renewables  
panels that generate electricity to produce  
hydrogen and then ammonia. One tonne of  
ammonia is produced every day and spread  
on the crops.  

, with solar  

“The average bag of fertiliser in sub-Saharan  
Africa travels 10,000 kilometres,” Talus founder  
“With a small  

Hiro Iwanaga told Bloomberg.  

green ammonia plant, like the one in Kenya,  
you can locally produce a critical raw material,  
carbon free.”  

Agriculture faces major challenges in solving  
climate emissions, and ammonia production is  
just one of them. But overall, a shift in ammonia  
production would have a major impact.  
Especially as ammonia also has great potential  
as a CO2-free fuel.  

Thei is demonstrated in Minnesota, where the  
state university runs a research farm that uses  
wind power to produce ammonia. It is then  
used for fertiliser, but also as fuel for tractors,  
to store energy for days without wind, and for  
heating to dry grain. In this way, the carbon

footprint can be reduced by as much as 90  
per cent.  

“That's transformative. For deep  
decarbonisation of agriculture, you switch to  
green ammonia,” says Michael Reese, director  
of the University of Minnesota project .
