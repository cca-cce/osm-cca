Shifting the climate narrative  

On 24 September 2024 we hosted an  

event titled "Can climate communication  

overcome the bad news problem?" at  

the Bibliothèque Solvay in Brussels and  

online. Participants heard from leading  

figures from journalism, politics,  

business, academia and NGOs who  

shared their insights on issues such as  

climate reporting, misinformation and  

public apathy.  

The discussions focused on shifting  

climate change narratives from despair  

to hope, encouraging action. Key  

takeaways included promoting  

responsibility, focusing on solutions, and  

addressing the seriousness of climate

change without instilling fear.  

Mark Lee Hunter’s reflections on the  

event.  

By Dr. Mark Lee Hunter  

When we began to think about this event, we  
understood that we were doing something  
different and risky. We were asking people  
from different sectors of communications, with  
very different values and roles, to share a stage  
and a common theme. If that theme – the  
necessity of finding new ways to alert and  
engage the public – had not been connected  
to the climate crisis, I think we would have  
found it impossible. To take one example, the  
event would have been meaningless without  
journalists and activists, and for both groups  
the idea of participating in an event sponsored  
by an energy company, even one owned by  
the Swedish state and committed to being  
fossil-free in the short term, might be out of the  
question. In fact, not everyone accepted our  
invitations, and one or two who did changed  
their minds at the last minute.

To me, that underlines the success of the  
event. By “‘success” I don’t mean the fact that  
over one million people viewed us online,  
though a few days beforehand we were  
thinking in terms of a few thousands. I mean  
that leaders in their respective fields of  
communication – hard news, investigative,  
constructive and solutions journalism, NGOs,  
scientists, media development specialists,  
even marketers – not only spoke, but also  
listened to each other, and found common  
ground.  
Early on in our research for the event, we  
became aware of an epochal shift taking place  
in the journalism community. Alexandra  
Borchardt had documented the adoption of  
solutions journalism as the way forward for  
public broadcasters caught between the need  
to inform their viewers about the urgency of  
the climate crisis and the requirement to  
abjure activism.

To me, that’s as significant as the rise of  
investigative journalism worldwide following  
Watergate (which I followed as a student, right  
into a career as a journalist). It’s now a given  
that we can’t just expose the facts. We are also  
responsible for enabling a useful response to  
the facts. That’s what people like Ulrik  
Haagerup of the Constructive Institute have  
spent decades fighting for, and the happiest  
moment for me at the conference was when I  
told him, “You’ve won that argument.”  

There was a “really? "moment when  
neuroscientist Kris de Meyer told us that  
action leads to knowledge, more than the  
other way around. Communicators of every  
kind, as Alexandra Borchardt has remarked,  
like to think that by pouring knowledge into the  
public domain, we inspire action. That certainly  
happens sometimes, as Emilia Diaz-Struck of  
the Global Investigative Journalism Network  
demonstrated in a moving declaration about  
the global impact of the Panama Papers. The  
point is that it’s not an either-or proposition. We  
have more than one path to inspire action –  
through stories of people who undertake it and  
are changed (which happens to be the classic  
theme of adventure stories), or by revealing  
what has been kept secret and must be  
stopped. Tom Brookes of the Meliore  
Foundation suggested a frame, backed by  
solid data, that arches over both approaches:  
saving the lives of future generations.

Panelists  

The depth of the global mobilisation to inform  
and inspire action on the climate became  
increasingly apparent. So did a series of  
victories – over indifference, avoidance and  
lack of capacity. Mitali Mukherjee of the  
Reuters Institute brought striking nuance to  
their recent studies on news avoidance: Yes, a  
significant minority of the public avoids climate  
news, and much bigger shares of the public  
declines to follow sports or celebrities. The  
message is that we’re doing better than we  
might have thought.  

More talent is entering the field – people like  
Anny Tubbs, who left a corporate career to  
make documentaries about the climate, or  
Boris van Westering, who brought investigative  
artwork into COP28 like a Trojan horse.  
Lagipoiva Cherelle Jackson of the Solutions  
Journalism Network pointed to a relatively  
untapped resource – local knowledge, from  
reporters or elders. Ivan Couronne of the

Agence France Presse’s “Future of the Planet”  
unit told us how to bring reporters from  
competing beats together on climate  
coverage. Syed Nazakat’s “Shakti” initiative in  
India showed how to construct a wide network  
of media to fight political disinformation; it  
could work for the climate, he said. Johan  
Gustafsson, an advertising executive who  
used “The World’s Ugliest Lawn” to make  
people think harder about water use – as Ivan  
Couronne said, “People don’t avoid climate  
stories, they avoid boring climate stories” –  
thinks that the future for his industry is an  
alliance of progressive firms with progressive  
creatives. There are still untouched reserves in  
this fight, and a big piece of them will come  
from collaboration across specialities and  
sectors.  

We knew from our pre-conference  
conversations with speakers and other  
sources that a great many initiatives can be  
considered experiments. That applies to the  
massive foundation support for training  
climate reporters. Tom Law of the Global  
Forum for Media Development warned that  
support for climate coverage can’t come at the  
expense of other issues that audiences care  
about. Syli, a UK-based NGO that builds  
enterprise skills and other capacity with  
independent media, is compiling data on its  
projects that will be open-sourced, promised  
one of its executives, Shereen Daver.

Anouk IJfs and Mark Lee Hunter.  

When Anouk IJfs and I were planning this  
event, we discovered that even the committed,  
very smart people we were talking with could  
get depressed about the climate. Well, me too.  
But I don’t feel that way today, even with record  
rains pouring down on me from the sky over  
France. I feel inspired, because the people I  
met on this project are making something  
happen and won’t give up.
